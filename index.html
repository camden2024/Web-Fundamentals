    <h1>Who is Camden Hendricks</h1>
    <img class="biopic" src="images/IMG_0345.jpg" width="800" alt="Profile Picture of Camden Hendricks">
    <p>I am Camden Hendricks, and I love to be outside and explore the vast lakes and green forests of the world. If I had to narrow down a few of my main hobbies, I would say I'm interested in flying, fishing, and skiing! I've also learned a couple languages throughout my life. Growing up, I lived in Germany and learned german. Later in life, I served a mission and had the great opertunity to learn Persion.</p>
    <p>I come from a family of 4 kids. Since my older siblings got married, we added a fun brother and sister to the mix. But I'm third in the line up with my younger brother in Brazil. We do a lot as a family. Although, we each have "our own things", we have grown close to eachother as we have moved around the country and tried new things. </p>
